# Welcome To My Portfolio

Here you will find a collection of assets I have developed either in full or in the majority, to showcase some of my past work.

None of the source files contained here are intended to be usable, i.e. they might not compile/execute/etc. Rather, they are intended to show off design choices, code style, and so on.

Please use this as a reference if you'd like, but keep in mind that in many cases the "core" components have been purposely removed or simplified to avoid leaking confidential details publicly. Business logic especially is gone but that also means a lot of complexity is typically missing as well. There's no avoiding it, unfortunately, for my private work. Just keep in mind that this is meant to provide a peek into my professional work and does not give a full picture.
